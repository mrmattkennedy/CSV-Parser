This project utilizes the stringstream class to parse a CSV file. It was written for the hashing assignment for CIS 263 - Data structures and Algorithms.
It takes an odd approach to CSV files - instead of moving past quotes to check for commas, it actually removes them from the quotes, then puts them back in after the rest of the file is parsed.
